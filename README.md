<sup>Be careful, I have had multiple library cards banned in the past from using this tool (See [#14](https://github.com/PsychedelicPalimpsest/LibbyRip/issues/14), [#12](https://github.com/PsychedelicPalimpsest/LibbyRip/issues/12), and [#8](https://github.com/PsychedelicPalimpsest/LibbyRip/issues/8) for more details) </sup>


## How to use

1. Install the [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension for your browser.
2. Install the userscript from the [GreasyFork page](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/498782-libregrab)
3. Find your audiobook on Libby and export.

**NOTE:** If you do not see anything, it _could_ be because TamperMonkey is not set up properly on Chrome (and chromeium based) browsers! See the TamperMonkey [FAQ](https://www.tampermonkey.net/faq.php#Q209) page here for more info.

## Using the Python Script (`bakeMetadata.py`)

This repository includes a Python script that allows you to bake metadata into your downloaded audiobook MP3s, either via the command-line or a GUI.

### Script Requirements

Python 3.x is required, along with the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running The Script

You can run the script in either **CLI mode** or **GUI mode**, depending on your needs:

#### Command-Line Mode

```bash
python bakeMetadata.py [<audiobook_directory>]
```

- If no directory is passed as an argument, you will be prompted to enter one.
- This mode is ideal for batch automation or terminal workflows.
- Output, progress, and errors will appear in the console.

#### GUI Mode

```bash
python bakeMetadata.py --gui [<audiobook_directory>]
```

- Launches a PyQt5 graphical interface.
- If no directory is passed, you'll be prompted to select one with a file dialog.
- All output and errors (including warnings like `Lame tag CRC check failed`) will be shown in a scrollable status window within the GUI instead of the terminal.
- Useful for users who prefer a more visual interface.

### What The Script Does

This script does the following:
- Loads the metadata exported with your audiobook from Libby (`metadata.json`).
- Embeds chapter information and cover art into each `Part *.mp3` file using the `eyed3` library.
- Sets ID3 tags including title, artist, album, and track number.

### Notes

- The audiobook directory **must** contain a `metadata` subdirectory with `metadata.json` and a cover image.
- The script assumes filenames follow the `Part X.mp3` naming convention.
- The message `Lame tag CRC check failed` is a **harmless warning** and can be safely ignored. It is now shown in the status window when using the GUI.

## Note on EPUBs
The EPUB downloader is **unstable**, and **unreliable**. It works with a majority of books, however Libby does some processing to the xhtml before it is sent to the client, so that needs repaired, and this is not perfect, in addition I have no experience with the EPUB format. I am always open to contributions, so if you find an issue and want to fix it, please do.
